# Insomnia HTTP client

Insomnia is a nice alternative to Postman.

Simple user interface. Can beautify JSON even if the data is not valid.

But Insomnia creators are becoming evil with login crap after release [2023.5.8](
https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/releases/tag/core%402023.5.8),
so this repository is a fork of the repository at that release on branch main.
